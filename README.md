# Loan-Power-BI-Analysis
To gain meaningful insights regarding the loan data that was used in my Loan-prediction repository, I conducted a thorough examination of the Course_Schedule_Data dataset. By carefully examining this dataset, I was able to identify trends and patterns that provide insight into the clients that applied for a loan.
